To convert an edi document to flat file we have to follow the below procedure. Firstly, 
Create a Dictionary: 
To create a Dictionary we have to use SEFParse Java Service (WmEDI-wm.b2b.edi: SEFParse). This service is used for generating Flat File dictionaries and schemas.

In SEFParser Service assign the following values in Service In under Pipeline Tab.
 SEFFileName:webMethods6IntegrationServerpackagesWmEDIpubSEFSX124010.sef (Here we parsing 4010 version EDI so we have to give 4010.sef).
 EDIDocName: Since we are parsing a 210 EDI we have to give the name asâ210â.
 Version: Its an optional filed here we can give version as â4010â.
 TargetSchema: Give the path of Schema where you want to create it  (Example: EDI_Parse: T210).
 TargetPackage: Give the package name (Ex: Default).
 TargetDictionary: Create an empty dictionary and give its path in this filed (Example: EDI_Parse: D210).
Now run the Parser service and refresh the server then automatically schema will be generated and dictionary will be filled with fields. 
 Create a Document Type:

 Select Schema in the Navigation Panel (Ex: T210)
 Now Click on Flat File Structure tab and click on document symbol then a document type will be created (EDI_Parse: T210DT).
Parsing Service:
Now create a service (example ParseEDI) for parsing an EDI file. 
First take the envelope process for validating the EDI file (WmEDIsamples-sampleServices: X12Values).


 Now click on âenvelope processâ service and double click on âedidataâ under pipeline tab and assign the edi 210 file.

 Assign the path of the schema in âEDIffSchemaâ field (Ex: EDI_ParseT210).
Take the Reference Document Type of EDI in pipeline out (Ex: T210DT).
 Now map EDIValues to the Reference Document Type.


Insert a map step and map the required fields from EDI Reference Doc to another Flat File Document type (Ex: FlatSchemaDT).
While mapping from multiple document to single document we have to convert multiple document to a single document by using a loop step and then map the fields.
While mapping to a multiple document use âappendToDocumentListâ service. 
Using appendToDocumentList Service:
Copy all fields from multiple documents.
Take a single document and append all fields under that document.
Now map the required fields to single document and assign null values to remaining fields.


Now use appendToDocumentList Service as shown above.
Take multiple document list in âPipeline Inâ under âPipelineâ tab (Ex: SingleDocList).
Now map Single document to âfromItemâ and multiple document to âtoListâ(Ex:SingleDoc to fromItem and SingleDocLIst to toList).
Now map toList in âService Outâ to SingleDocList in PipeLine Out.
Now map this SingleDocList to main Multiple document list.


  Now insert convertToString Service (WmFlatFile-pub.flatFile: convertToString) and map Flat file Document type to ffValues.
  Give Flat file Schema by double clicking ffSchema Ex: EDI_Parse: FlatSchema).
 We will get Flat File String as output.
