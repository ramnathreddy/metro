Cluster setup:

for clustering we have used oracle coherance and terracotta. What does your project use for IS clustering in test and prod environments?

 yes, you will need either Coherence and Terracotta. If I recall correctly, 8.2 was the last version to offer Coherence as an option. Since then, the only option is Terracotta. Therefore, we can scratch the idea of using Coherence because it makes no sense for you to setup a Coherence-based cluster now and then have to convert it to Terracotta in your next upgrade. 

Terracotta requires additional installation and configuration so one of the first things you will have to do is

(1) identify what version of Terracotta you need for your version of IS 
(http://documentation.softwareag.com/webmethods/wmsuites/Current_webMethods_and_Terracotta_Compatibility_Matrix.pdf) and then 
(2) download that version of Terracotta from Empower. 

Next, you'll have to install it, which typically involves unzipping a file into a directory of your choice. The basic clustering license 
allows you to create a simple Terracotta Server Array (TSA) with a pair of active-passive servers, which means you'll likely be installing
Terracotta on two separate servers. Many customers with the typical 2-node cluster choose to simply install Terracotta on the same 
servers as the IS but you don't have to do this. Up to you. 

Once Terracotta is installed, you now need to configure it. The vast majority of the configuration is done through a file 
called tc-config.xml. 

This page on Empower appears to have some good info for you to follow:

Terracotta’s architecture is substantially different from that of Oracle Coherence. Coherence was installed as a library within the 
Integration Server container, and a cluster was formed by configuring multiple Coherence instances to communicate with each other.
Coherence did not run on a separate server or even in a separate Java Virtual Machine (JVM®). 
The minimum cluster size recommended was four nodes, and it relied on multicast, a less desirable option for cloud environments.

Terracotta has two components: the local Ehcache library and the Terracotta Server Array (TSA). 
The local Ehcache library, installed with webMethods Integration Server, is used for in-memory caching of local data and runs
within the Integration Server JVM. The TSA provides distributed caching and clustering. In order to cluster multiple webMethods 
servers or share information between multiple servers, the TSA is installed as a separate run- time.
