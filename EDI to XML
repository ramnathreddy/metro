get those mapping specs from your business analyst/functional area team and follow up with them to
create excel sheet with source to target field mappings (edi to xml or xml to edi what ever format is)
                       
                       
Sample Business Process
The WmEDIsamples package, which you can download from the Knowledge Base on the Advantage Web
site at http://advantage.webmethods.com, provides a sample that illustrates one way of using EDI
documents in a business process. To read an overview of the sample, learn how to set it up and to run it,
perform the following procedure.

Note: If you intend to also run the sample provided for the webMethods EDIINT Module
(which is also included in the WmEDIsamples package), set up the EDIINT Module
sample before setting up this sample business process.
 
 
Demonstrates the use of the iterator variable of the wm.b2b.edi:convertToValues service to parse large input data
by processing it piece by piece. Each time the wm.b2b.edi:convertToValues service is invoked, the iterator
variable is set to true. 
The format of the EDIFFSchema.X12.V4010:Sample810_Large flat file schema dictates how the service processes
the sample 810 document. This flat file schema defines three top-level segment structures: 1) ST, 2) IT1, and
3) TDS.
The first time the Iterator810 service invokes the wm.b2b.edi:convertToValues service, the ST segment structure is
processed. It reads the input data from the sample 810 document until it encounters the next top-level
segment structure, which is the first IT1 segment structure. The Iterator810 service invokes the
wm.b2b.edi:convertToValues service for each IT1 segment structure until it encounters the TDS segment
structure. After processing the TDS segment structure, the Iterator810 service exists the REPEAT loop
because there is no more input data. The Iterator810 service determines there is no more input when
ediObject, which is an output parameter from the wm.b2b.edi:convertToValues service, is null.
Because the wm.b2b.edi:convertToValues service always returns its output in EDIValues, each pass of the service
invocation should save the output or map it somewhere else. In this example, the main iteration maps each
segment under ISA. In the iteration steps under the ST segment, an empty sequence operation is used. This
can be replaced by services that process one item in the invoice. The services have access to the current
items as well as all of the information in ISA, GS, ST and other segments under ST.This service does not
validate or check the structure of any segments.

TASK: EDI To XML
OS: WindowsOS
Platform: webMethods 6.1

This task takes EDI data and converts it into XML data. 
To achieve this, the following Flow Steps are usedâ¦ 
1.    pub.file:getFile
2.    wm.b2b.edi:convertToValues
3.    pub.xml:documentToXMLString
4.    sample.IO.test:writeToFile

1. pub.file:getFile: 
This flow step reads the data according to the specified path and converts into bytes.
alt

Set the Filename path and overwriteflag 
Mapping for this flow step.

alt

2. wm.b2b.edi:convertToValues: 
ConvertToValues service is used to convert the bytes into EDIValues using the EDI schema. (For creating EDI Schema refer How to Create EDI Schema?) 
            Mapping for this flow step.
alt

3. pub.xml:documentToXMLString: 
documentToXMLString service is used to convert the EDIValues into XML data. 
Mapping for this flow step.

alt

4. sample.IO.test: writeToFile:
This flow takes the XMLData and writes into the XML file according to specified path.
Mapping for this flow step

alt

Ã  OverwriteFlag must be specified to overwrite/Append
