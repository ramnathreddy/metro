Stateless services

If a stateless service is invoked (Stateless=True), then IS still establishes a session, but the session is immediately terminated 
as soon as the top-level service completes the execution and IS does not pass a session cookie back to the client.
Use of stateless services can help improve performance of an IS by releasing session resources as soon as they are no longer needed.

Stateful services

In a default condition (Stateless=False), IS establishes a session and passes the session ID to the client in the session cookie.
After the service invocation, IS keeps the session object in memory for future calls.The session is terminated either by the client 
explicitly destroying the session (e.g. by invoking wm.server:disconnect) or when the session times out after a given period of inactivity. The session timeout defaults to 10 minutes and can be configured in IS Administrator under Settings > Resources.
